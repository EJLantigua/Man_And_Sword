# Man & Sword Version 1.0:

## --Controls of Player--
* W Key - Move Up
* A Key - Move Left
* S Key - Move Down
* D Key - Move Right

## --What Was Done In This Version--
* - Setup character, slime enemy, tree, shadow, and bush Sprites with RigidBody2D components on a canvas GameObject
* - Utilized the built in Unity Input System Package instead of hard coding the controls on a separate script
* - Wrote scripts to help make the player move.
* - Wrote an EnemyAI script that makes the slimes roam around randomly
* - Animated the player to idle and move player utilizing the Unity Animator Feature which involved some scripting to run the animation while movement control conditions were met
